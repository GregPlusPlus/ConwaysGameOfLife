# Conway's Game of Life
This project is a simple implementation of the famous "Conway's Game of Life", written in Javascript (and HTML &amp; CSS obviously). At the beggining, it was a personal project only for fun and challenge, but now I want to share some code to see how other people can improve it... Enjoy!
